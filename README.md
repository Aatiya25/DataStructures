# DataStructures
Introduction to Data Structures in Python


Data structures are the building block to create any software program. It tells us how to execute instructions to build efficient code.

What is the need for the Data structure:

Let's say to bake a cake from scratch, we need to desired ingredients and need to follow step by step process to create the batter before it is kept in the oven. Similarly, to build an efficient software application, we need data structures(ingredient) and executable code instruction(step by step process).

-It helps to create a fast and powerful algorithm

-It creates a clean and readable code.

-Helps to manage and organize the data.

Suppose you own a jewelry store and wants to know the price of gold on Day1 or Day6. So, here you care about the day sequence pricing list and can access the same using lists for Day1 and Day6 respectively:

price[0]: Price on Day 1

price[6]: Price on Day 6

But if you want to check the price for a specific date. 

Example: What were the gold prices on March 1 and June 1?

For this you can create Dictionary to access price on particular days:

price={
	'March 1':50000,
	'April 1': 52000,
	'May 1': 53000,
	'June 1': 55000
}

price['March 1']-----> Gives the price value on March 1

price['June 1']------> Gives the price value for June 1

It would have been quite clear for different problems different data structures have been used. For the first problem, we used lists and for the second we used dictionaries.
You can't be a good programmer if you don't have the right knowledge on what data structure (ingredient) to be used for your problem.
